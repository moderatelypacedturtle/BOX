SparkCore NeoPixel Matrix
==========================

This is a port of Adafruit's NeoPixel Matrix [Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoMatrix) for the [Spark](http://spark.io). Porting this over was very easy thanks to the work done by [technobly](https://github.com/technobly) porting the NeoPixel [library](https://github.com/technobly/SparkCore-NeoPixel) over.

Installation
-----------

- You should be able to just add the library via the Web IDE and include
  "neomatrix/neomatrix.h" (It should add it for you)
- You can compile locally using the Spark CLI tool but you'll need to download
  the libraries in resources section.

Resources
--------

- [SparkCore-NeoPixel](https://github.com/technobly/SparkCore-NeoPixel)
- [Adafruit_TFT](https://github.com/lbarrosoneto/Adafruit_TFT)

Contributions
------------

All of them. I'll probably compile them first to make sure but I can't image there's
too much to break.

Again, so much thanks to [technobly](https://github.com/technobly). Porting that
library over made this one pretty easy.
